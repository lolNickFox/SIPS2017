Single paper meta-analysis

Why would you want to do this?
  Aggregate findings - increase power of underpowered studies
  
Intro to meta analyses
  
  Meta-analyses assumes the effect sizes are independent
    one effect size per study
    
  Example
  
  Study 1 - 1 chocolate vs 5 chocolate --> happiness
  Study 2 - (1 chocolate vs 5 chocolate) x (crappy vs great) --> happiness
  
  What do we use?
    Can get all 3 effect sizes (2 from study 2, one from study 1)
    Can just take the first part of study 2 and compare to study 1 (two effect sizes total)
    
  
  Assumes that all studies have the same population effect size
    all variation we see from study to study is purely due to sampling error
    
  Average weighted by 1/variance of each effect size
    More precise effect sizes get more weight
    Generally this means that larger studies get more weight
    Assumes you are not biasing the data you're putting in (creative removal of outliers can bias towards bigger effect sizes within these studies being used)
    
    Tells you the average of THESE studies
      Doesn't justify generalizing to studies outside of your sample (great for your studies on chocolate and happiness, but not the entire population)
