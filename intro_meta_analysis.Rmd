Single paper meta-analysis

Why would you want to do this?
  Aggregate findings - increase power of underpowered studies
  
Intro to meta analyses
  
  Meta-analyses assumes the effect sizes are independent
    one effect size per study
    
  Example
  
  Study 1 - 1 chocolate vs 5 chocolate --> happiness
  Study 2 - (1 chocolate vs 5 chocolate) x (crappy vs great) --> happiness
  
  What do we use?
    Can get all 3 effect sizes (2 from study 2, one from study 1)
    Can just take the first part of study 2 and compare to study 1 (two effect sizes total)
